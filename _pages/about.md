I am a Harrison Early Career Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/). <br> 
Previously, I was a postdoc at the [University of Torino](https://www.esomas.unito.it/do/home.pl)  with [Pierpaolo De Blasi](https://sites.google.com/a/carloalberto.org/pdeblasi/). I  obtained my PhD in Statistics at [Bocconi](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Bocconi/SitoPubblico_EN/Navigation+Tree/Home/Faculty+and+Research/Departments/Decision+Sciences/) University, under the supervision of [Antonio Lijoi](http://mypage.unibocconi.it/antoniolijoi/) and [Igor Prünster](http://didattica.unibocconi.it/mypage/index.php?IdUte=187032&cognome=PRUENSTER&nome=IGOR&urlBackMy=). <br> 
I am also member of the "de Castro" Statistics Initiative at [Collegio Carlo Alberto](https://www.carloalberto.org/research/statistics-initiative/), of the [BayesLab](https://bayeslab.unibocconi.eu/) at the Bocconi Institute for Data Science and Analytics ([BIDSA](https://www.bidsa.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/Site/Bidsa/Home)) and of the [MIDAS](https://midas.mat.uc.cl/network/) Complex Data Modeling Research Network.<br>
